                                Designed a fully functional web application that allows generous donors to make 
                                a contribution to the U District community. It helps to raise money for their parklet
                                located outside Bulldog News in Seattle. I worked with React, JavaScript, and CSS
                                to develop the application. I also used Adobe XD to create a prototype and shot/edited
                                my own photos for the web application using Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.
